    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Muffins are an easy and quick to make dessert</p>
   
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>half a teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>3 quarters of a cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>a quarter of a cup of vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>
        <li>Stir flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl; make a well in the center. </li>
        <li>Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup; whisk in milk and oil. </li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture all at once into flour mixture; mix quickly and lightly with a fork until just moistened. The batter will be lumpy. (Fold in additional ingredients if using; see variations below). </li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
