    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>spaghetti is an easy and a quick dish to make</p>
    
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Tomatoes and tomato paste</li>
        <li>Onion, garlic, and spices</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You will start by making the easy meat sauce. Brown your meat in a bit of oil, and then stir in onions until they soften. Then add lots of flavor with garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes. To finish the sauce, add a bit of water (or broth) and crushed tomatoes. Our easy sauce simmers for about 25 minutes, so about 15 minutes before it is ready, you can cook your spaghetti.</li>
        <li>    For the best spaghetti, cook it in salted water. Pasta water should taste salty. I add a lot of salt to our pasta water (it makes the pasta taste delicious). I add about one tablespoon of salt for every four quarts (16 cups) of water, which is perfect for cooking one pound of pasta.</li>
